# **Motivation**

***

DNA methylation-based *epigenetic clocks* have transformed aging research by 
providing quantitative markers of biological age that often outperform 
chronological age in predicting morbidity, frailty, and mortality. Although 
most established clocks to date rely on penalized linear regression (e.g., 
elastic net), recent works have demonstrated that deep learning may capture 
richer nonlinear relationships among DNA methylation sites, improving 
predictive accuracy.

This case study walks learners through reconstructing a neural network 
epigenetic clock model in the `R` statistical programming language. Learners 
will use `scorcher`, an `R` package designed for developing deep learning 
models with ease. The goal is to give the learners a hands-on experience 
working with DNA methylation data, introduce epigenetic clock models, teach 
modern neural network construction in `R`, and highlight practical modeling 
issues such as overfitting, interpretability, and biological validation.

**Epigenetic clocks** are statistical or machine learning models that estimate 
an individual's biological age by learning systematic patterns in DNA 
methylation levels at specific genomic locations (CpG sites). These models 
leverage age-associated changes in methylation to produce an age estimate that 
can reflect not only chronological time but also aspects of biological aging, 
health status, and disease risk.
