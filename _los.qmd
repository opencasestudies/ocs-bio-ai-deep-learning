# **Learning Objectives**

<!--
  Replace the shell content and enumerate the learning objectives in the 
  referenced qmd files. For an example of this section, see this previous 
  Open Case Study: 
  
  https://www.opencasestudies.org/ocs-bp-co2-emissions/#Learning_Objectives

  Statistical LOs were provided in the original open case studies but they may 
  be omitted here depending on the case study. 
  
  Biological LOS were not provided in the original open case studies and should 
  be included in all Bio-OCS case studies.

In this case study, we will explore how deep learning methods can be applied 
to high-dimensional biological data, using DNA methylation-based epigenetic 
clocks as our motivation.

This case study will particularly focus on the practical and conceptual 
challenges that arise when building neural network models for omics-scale 
biological data, including data preprocessing, regularization, model 
evaluation, and comparison with classical statistical approaches such as 
elastic net regression. We will exemplify these concepts in within `R` 
ecosystem using the `R` package, `scorcher`.

The skills, methods, and concepts that students will be familiar with by the 
end of this case study are:
