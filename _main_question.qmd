Our main question(s)

::::{.inner_block}

1. Can a neural network-based epigenetic clock accurately predict chronological 
age from publicly-available DNA methylation data?

2. How does a deep learning-based epigenetic clock compare to a more 
traditional, elastic net-based clock when trained on the same, harmonized data?

3. What practical challenges arise when applying deep learning model to 
high-dimensional biological data, and how can these challenges be addressed in 
a reproducible R workflow?
