<u>**Data Science/Bioinformatics Learning Objectives:**</u>

<!--
Enumerate the Data Science or Bioinformatic specific learning objectives here.
(Can have more than 3).
For an example, see this previous Open Case Study: 
https://www.opencasestudies.org/ocs-bp-co2-emissions/#Learning_Objectives
-->

1. Work with high-dimensional biological datasets and understand common data 
structures used in -omics analyses.

2. Implement reproducible data preprocessing and wrangling workflows in `R` 
for large-scale datasets.

3. Train, tune, and evaluate deep learning-based predictive models using 
modern machine learning workflows such as `scorcher`.

4. Compare model performance using appropriate validation strategies and 
metrics.

5. Reason about computational tradeoffs, including memory usage, runtime, and 
the use of GPUs.
