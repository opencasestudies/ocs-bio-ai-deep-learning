1. Describe the biological basis of DNA methylation and its relationship to 
aging.

2. Explain what epigenetic clocks are, how they are constructed, and their 
historical development.

3. Understand sources of biological and technical variation in methylation 
data.

4. Learn how to preprocess and wrangle large DNA methylation datasets.
