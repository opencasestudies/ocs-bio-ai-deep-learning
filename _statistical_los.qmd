<u>**Statistical Learning Objectives:**</u>

<!--
  Enumerate the Statistical specific learning objectives here. (Can have more 
  or less than 3 or be omitted completely dependent on the open case study 
  overall topic). For an example, see this previous Open Case Study: 
  https://www.opencasestudies.org/ocs-bp-co2-emissions/#Learning_Objectives
-->

1. Explain the bias-variance tradeoff in high-dimensional prediction problems.

2. Describe penalized regression methods (e.g., elastic net) and their role in 
feature selection.

3. Understand loss functions, regularization, and optimization in neural 
network training.

4. Design and interpret cross-validation and study-level validation strategies.

5. Critically assess interpretability versus complexity when building 
prediction models.
